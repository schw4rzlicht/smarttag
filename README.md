smarttag is a simple to use web tool which enables people to search for related hashtags on Instagram and generate a 
curated list of hashtags for their next Instagram post considering hashtag relations and uses.

While Instagram limited their public [API back in 2018](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/instagram-api-limit/), 
smarttag visits Instagram for you and gets the data using a script that runs completely in your browser. You don't need 
to log in our authenticate in any way, in fact we encourage users to keep logged out when using smarttag so that 
Instagram is not able to track your search efforts.
